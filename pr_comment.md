To test this PR introducing the new login interface, I will:

- Open the app homepage and confirm the new login interface is displayed clearly
- Verify input fields for username/email, password, and the login button are present
- Attempt login with valid credentials to ensure successful authentication and redirection to purchase/home page
- Attempt login with invalid credentials and confirm appropriate error messages appear
- Check the login interfaceâ€™s visual layout and responsiveness on various screen sizes
- After login, validate user can access grocery buying features without issues
- Test logout functionality to confirm session ends properly and login screen reappears

This will ensure the login UI is visually correct, functional, and integrates smoothly with app features.
