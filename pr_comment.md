# Code Turtle Review in progress

### Testing Plan

- **Launch the Application:**
  - Open the web application in a supported browser to start the review.

- **Navigate to the Main Page:**
  - Confirm that the homepage loads without any errors.

- **Check Application Header:**
  - Verify the header contains the expected title/logo for consistency with the site's branding.

- **Verify Basic Functionalities:**
  - Click through the primary sections or links in the main navigation bar to ensure they load correctly.

- **Test New Feature or Change:**
  - Due to the lack of detail in the PR, observe the UI for any new elements or changes and interact with them, such as clicking buttons, filling forms, or hovering over items.

- **Ensure No Breakages:**
  - Check that existing features, including page loading and data presentation, continue to function as they should.

### Key Areas to Focus On
- Visual integrity of elements like headers and navigation.
- Smoothness of navigation across different sections.
- Detection and testing of any new or modified elements.

### Expected Outcomes
- All application pages should not exhibit errors or excessive load times.
- Current features must operate without issues.
- The introduction of new features or changes should integrate smoothly without disruption.

I will ensure my actions are straightforward and directly engage with the user interface, focusing on essential elements.
