To test the new login interface introduced in this PR, I will:  
- Open the appâ€™s home page and navigate to the new login screen.  
- Verify all expected UI elements are present (username/email input, password input, login button).  
- Submit the form with valid credentials and confirm successful login by checking redirection to the grocery purchasing area or dashboard.  
- Attempt login with invalid credentials to ensure appropriate error messages appear and access is denied.  
- Test the login UI responsiveness and usability on multiple screen sizes.  
- Check for any broken links or visual issues in the login component.  

This will confirm the login interface is fully functional, user-friendly, and visually consistent across devices.
