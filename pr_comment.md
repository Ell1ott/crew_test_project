To test the "Add user dashboard feature" PR, I will:

- Launch the app and log in with valid user credentials.
- Confirm redirection to the new dashboard page post-login.
- Verify the dashboard displays user profile info, recent activities, and account settings.
- Test responsive layout by resizing the browser across mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
- Attempt to access the dashboard URL without logging in to confirm authentication enforcement.
- Log out from the dashboard and ensure session termination and redirection to login.
- Interact with dashboard UI elements to ensure proper functionality and no broken components.

This ensures authentication, correct data display, responsive design, and proper user flow are all validated.
