# Code Turtle Review in progress

## Testing plan

- Open the main page and any key pages of the web application in a browser.
- Verify the background color is changed to red on these pages.
- Navigate through different views or sections, if applicable, to ensure the red background appears consistently.
- Check that all text, buttons, and UI elements remain clearly visible and are not obscured by the red background.
- Confirm there are no visual glitches or layout issues caused by the background color change.

This will validate that the red background change is applied correctly and consistently without impacting usability.
