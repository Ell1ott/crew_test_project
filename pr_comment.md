To test this PR that adds a new login interface, I will:

- Open the app and ensure the login screen appears as the entry point.  
- Verify presence of username/email and password input fields, along with a login button.  
- Submit the form with empty inputs and check for appropriate validation errors.  
- Enter valid credentials and confirm successful redirection to the main grocery purchase interface.  
- Try invalid credentials to see clear and informative error messages.  
- Test responsiveness of the login UI on different screen sizes.  
- Check accessibility features like keyboard navigation and screen reader support.  

This will ensure the login interface is functional, user-friendly, and integrated correctly before accessing purchase features.
